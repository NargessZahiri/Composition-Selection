%%%% You can use these graphs for testing the code
%%%% Each given square matrix B is the input of the code that is received from the user in the mentioned tool. 
%%%% In fact, each dimension of the matrix indicates the number of nodes in the graph, and each member, which is a number between 0 and 1, indicates the probability of a link between two nodes in the graph. 
%%%% The number 0 means that the two nodes in question are not connected to each other, the number one means that there is a definite link between the two nodes, and any number between 0 and one indicates the probability of a connection between the two nodes. 
%%%% The following examples contain matrices with different sizes and probabilities, which represent graphs with different number of nodes and structural patterns.
